## Preparation

1. You must create an .env file based on the .env.example file.It describes the environment variables for the project. The particularly important ones concern OAuth2 via github. You need to create a github app in the developer settings and use the generated keys.

2. After you do this, remember to run the command:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

## Turn on the demo

```bash
python3 manage.py loaddata data.json
```

This command will fill the database with content that will allow you to evaluate **most** of the application's features.

This example creates 3 users with the same passwords (321qwe,./):

| User      | Email                 |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| TestUser1 | <testuser1@mall.com>  |
| TestUser2 | <testuser2@mall.com>  |
| TestUser3 | <testuser3@mall.com>  |

Use them to get a peek behind the scenes!

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
